            Travelling by a state-owned bus is nothing short of torture. The buses are old and ill-main frequency of bus service is low and the conductors are unsympathetic and sometimes even buses never bother to stopâ€™, at their assigned stops and thus cause unnecessary discom commuters. Since state buses arc the cheapest means of conveyance, they are always owerwerd even ladies and old persons have to sometimes travel standing. Due to the constant movement of passengers from the rear gate to the front gate, the sensitive toes of the standing passengers often get hurt. Hot words are exchanged now and then. The pickpockets and eve-teasers have a field day. The victims are young women and teenagers. Thus travelling by a state-owned bus may sometimes prove an ordeal.
